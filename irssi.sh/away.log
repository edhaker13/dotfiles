21:53 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: Actually it isn't, I came upon the same problem while refactoring some stuff.
21:58 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: Shouldn't.
22:22 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: They should be
22:39 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: Should still be ~/.flexget/plugins
23:16 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: But it's not usable? What error are you getting when running normally?
23:36 #flexget: ?/<g2/ gggazpachokingg?/>g eHeh, I was pointing at >/edhaker13g

00:15 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: Well, I'm not sure what's wrong with yours. Try to run the new build and see what directories it's trying to load plugins from.
00:15 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: Do you have the plugin in a subfolder of ~/.flexget/plugins?
00:19 #flexget: ?/<g2/ g:/gazpachokingg?/>g eedhaker13: Let me test that again too.
